Completely serverless, distributed, decentralized, p2p music streaming app for your desktop.

Development of pathephone-desktop is currently suspended in favor of [pathephone-web](https://github.com/pathephone/pathephone-web). It will be probably reanimated and refactored to use shared UI once pathephone-web will be finished.
